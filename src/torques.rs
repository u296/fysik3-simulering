    we can assume that the torque should be proportional to the area
    of the sphere (thus rÂ²), the drag coefficient, as well as the speed
    of the surface (omega * r) which means


    unit analysis gives C * omega^2 * r^5 * rho

    since in the other equation, C = 0.5 * C_D * pi we can assume the same here
